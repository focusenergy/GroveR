Description: Declarative programming for data-centered applications.  Declare data objects in terms of
  how they are created from other objects.  Benefits include automatic caching of intermediate artifacts;
  intelligent rebuilding of artifacts when dependencies change; standardized naming of data artifacts
  throughout the application; configurable logging of artifact creation; graphical tools to show
  data dependencies.
